# GFMS2
The Wheel Reinventor(s) bring you - General File Management Software 2, a new program (keyword: designed to be) for putting all of your things in one place.

To set your own GFMS2 up, download the entire 'GFMS2' folder (once it's up), and follow the instructions attached. You may also like to write your own plugins on top of the base packet - some examples will (eventually) pop up in the 'MODEL_EXTENSIONS' folder, and the base packet guide will include and installation and specification for these plugins.

For further information please reference [the wiki](https://github.com/gantnitsa/GFMS2/wiki).

The Wheel Reinventor(s) hope you have a nice day!
